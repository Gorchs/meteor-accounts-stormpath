## gorchs:accounts-stormpath

First of all: this package is based on robfallows great post on how to develop your own Imgur Oauth package that can be found here:

http://robfallows.github.io/2015/12/17/writing-an-oauth-2-handler.html

So, my appreciation and credits hereby.

An ES2015 Meteor OAuth handler package for Stormpath.

This is a fully working OAuth login service, allowing you to use Stormpath as your Meteor authentication method. If you want to use it "as is" you can just enter: 
``` bash
meteor add gorchs:accounts-stormpath
```
to your application.

See also the complementary OAuth flow package: gorchs:stormpath
